# Java Practice Problems 🧠💻

Welcome to my **JavaPracticeProblems** repository — a growing collection of Java programs I've created while learning the core foundations of Java. Each file is a snapshot of a specific concept or practice challenge I’ve worked through as I build confidence and fluency in the language.
